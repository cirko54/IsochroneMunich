precompute_travel_times.py

Purpose:
precompute_travel_times.py is a script designed to precompute travel times between stops using data from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). By calculating these times in advance, the application can avoid performing time-intensive calculations in real-time, thereby improving performance and responsiveness.

Output:
The script generates a data file containing precomputed travel times between stops, which can be loaded and used by the main application (isochrone_calculator.py) for efficient isochrone calculations.

Setup

    Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

    pip install pandas geopy networkx

    Data Requirements:
        The GTFS stop_times.txt and stops.txt files should be placed in the data/ directory.
        stop_times.txt should contain arrival and departure times, while stops.txt should provide coordinates for each stop.

    Configuration File: Make sure config.py contains the appropriate constants (e.g., ISOCHRONE_MAX_DISTANCE_METERS) that might be referenced by the script.

Script Overview

The precompute_travel_times.py script performs the following tasks:

    Load GTFS Data: It reads GTFS files to access stop locations and schedules.

    Calculate Travel Times: Using algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, it computes shortest paths or estimated travel times between all relevant stops, based on transport modes or defined weights.

    Save Computed Data: The calculated travel times are stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV), which can then be used by other application modules.

Configuration

    ISOCHRONE_MAX_DISTANCE_METERS (in config.py): Maximum distance in meters for calculating isochrone boundaries.
    GTFS File Paths: Paths to GTFS data files are defined in the script.

Ensure these are configured correctly before running the script.
Running the Script

To run the script, navigate to the project root directory and execute:

python scripts/precompute_travel_times.py

Functions
load_gtfs_data()

    Purpose: Loads stops.txt and stop_times.txt files into data frames.
    Parameters: None
    Returns: stops_df, stop_times_df (Pandas DataFrames for stop locations and schedules).

calculate_travel_times(stops_df, stop_times_df)

    Purpose: Calculates the travel times between stops based on the GTFS data.
    Parameters:
        stops_df: DataFrame containing stop coordinates.
        stop_times_df: DataFrame containing stop schedules and sequences.
    Returns: Dictionary with travel times between stops.
    Details:
        Utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm or a similar method to calculate shortest paths.
        Travel times are calculated in seconds or minutes, depending on configuration.

save_travel_times(travel_times, output_path)

    Purpose: Saves the precomputed travel times to a file.
    Parameters:
        travel_times: Dictionary containing travel times between stops.
        output_path: Path to the output file.
    Returns: None
    Details: Stores the data in a format like JSON for easy retrieval.

Output Format

The output data is saved in JSON format and structured as follows:

{
    "stop_id_1": {
        "stop_id_2": travel_time_in_seconds,
        "stop_id_3": travel_time_in_seconds
    },
    "stop_id_2": {
        "stop_id_1": travel_time_in_seconds,
        "stop_id_4": travel_time_in_seconds
    }
}

Each stop_id maps to other stops, with travel times indicating the time (in seconds or minutes) required to reach each respective stop.
Examples
Example Run

    Run the Script:

    python scripts/precompute_travel_times.py

    Expected Output: After running, you’ll find a file named travel_times.json in the scripts/output/ directory containing precomputed travel times.

    Usage in Main Application: Load the precomputed travel times in isochrone_calculator.py for faster isochrone calculations.

Additional Notes

    Accuracy: The travel times may vary based on schedule data precision. For best results, use accurate, high-precision GTFS data.
    Precomputing for Specific Modes: Consider filtering or organizing data by transport modes (e.g., bus, train) if that will be useful for future calculations.
    Scalability: If handling a large dataset (e.g., national or regional), consider optimizing data loading and travel time calculations to reduce memory and CPU usage.
